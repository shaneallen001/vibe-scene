# Git Save (Full)

When the user asks to "save to git", "save it to git", "fully save to git", or similar:

1. **Stage** all changes: `git add -A`
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message (summarize what changed)
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push origin main` (or the current branch)

Use the project's shell (PowerShell on Windows: use `;` not `&&` between commands). Do not stop at commit unless the user only asked to commit.
